## Git

In this exercise, a gitlab account was created. The altschool-cloud-exercises project was cloned to my local system and git configurations consisting of name and email took place. Below are images showing the output of the commands, <code>git config -l</code>, <code>git remote -v </code> and <code>git log</code> respectively-

<code>git config -l</code> is used to list all variables set in the config file along with their values.
<code>git remote -v</code> is used to manage the set of tracked repositories.
<code>git log</code> is used to view the history all the commits made in that repository.

Git is an open source version control system software that allows users track, manage codes and files over a period of time. It gives you access to various versions of the changes made to your code and allows effective collaboration between users across the globe. Github is a web application that allows you host your code in repositories. Another web hosting service is gitlab.

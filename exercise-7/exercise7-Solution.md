## BASH SCRIPT

BASH stands for Bourne Again Shell. Bash is the shell the linux environment uses to communicate with the kernel. Bash scripting allows you to automate tasks by performing a set of commands. Bash script consists of functions, conditionals, iterations, varaiables, arguements, e.t.c and it has its own syntax to follow when writing it. 

Crontab is a service that is used to schedule your bash script.

In this exercise, a bash script was written to run every hour, saving the system memory usage to a a file and at midnight, the file would be sent to an email address and the process starts afresh again.
Below is the content of the script written, the cronjob and the email sent respectively.
